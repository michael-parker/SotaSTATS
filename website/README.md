  This will walk you through the basics of installing/setting up the SotaSTATS website

This is not the complete site, only the barebones structures that you'd need to make your own and see what clusterfuck I made.
Includes are missing, layouts are missing.

dbInclude needs to have db login info put in, and then put in a folder that's up a level from the main website in a folder called /ucfg with proper permissions, path from main website is ../ucfg/dbInclude
